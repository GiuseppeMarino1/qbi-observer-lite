# qbi-observer-lite
QBI-Observer Lite+ is an open-source cognitive self-observation module derived from QBI-Core. It detects mental loops, internal questions, and metacognitive patterns. Not AGI. Not autonomous. Itâ€™s a transparent, ethical entry point into a new class of AI: Artificial Integrated Cognition (AIC).
